# 🌱 Usage

This document provides guidelines on how to use the Plant Disease Detection project for detecting diseases in plants using machine learning models and computer vision techniques.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/plant-disease-detection.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: 
   Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download Datasets**: 
   Download datasets of images containing healthy and diseased plants for training and evaluation purposes.

4. **Train the Model**: 
   Customize the model architecture, hyperparameters, and training process according to your requirements.

5. **Perform Inference**: 
   Use the trained model to perform inference on new images of plants to detect diseases.

## 🌱 Example Usage

Here's an example of how to use the Plant Disease Detection project for detecting diseases in plants:

```python
# Load pre-trained model
model = load_model('path/to/pretrained_model.h5')

# Preprocess input image
image = cv2.imread('path/to/input_image.jpg')
resized_image = cv2.resize(image, (64, 64))
normalized_image = resized_image / 255.0

# Perform inference
prediction = model.predict(np.expand_dims(normalized_image, axis=0))
predicted_label = np.argmax(prediction)

# Display result
print("Predicted Disease Label:", predicted_label)
```
