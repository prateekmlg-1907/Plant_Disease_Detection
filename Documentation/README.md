# 🌱 Plant Disease Detection 🌿

Welcome to the Plant Disease Detection project repository! This project aims to detect diseases in plants using machine learning and computer vision techniques.

## 📚 Overview

Plant diseases can have devastating effects on crop yields and food security. Early detection is crucial for farmers to take preventive measures. This project leverages machine learning to automatically identify diseases in plants from images.

## 📦 Contents

- **Code**: Implementation of machine learning models and algorithms.
- **Datasets**: Datasets of images containing healthy and diseased plants.
- **Documentation**: Guidelines, tutorials, and examples for using the project.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/plant-disease-detection.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: 
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download Datasets**: 
   Download datasets from sources like Kaggle or academic repositories.

4. **Train the Model**: 
   Customize the model architecture and hyperparameters, then train the model using the provided code and datasets.

5. **Perform Inference**: 
   Use the trained model to detect diseases in new plant images.

## 🌱 Example Usage

Here's how to use the Plant Disease Detection project:
```python
# Load pre-trained model
model = load_model('path/to/pretrained_model.h5')

# Preprocess input image
image = cv2.imread('path/to/input_image.jpg')
resized_image = cv2.resize(image, (64, 64))
normalized_image = resized_image / 255.0

# Perform inference
prediction = model.predict(np.expand_dims(normalized_image, axis=0))
predicted_label = np.argmax(prediction)

# Display result
print("Predicted Disease Label:", predicted_label)
```
